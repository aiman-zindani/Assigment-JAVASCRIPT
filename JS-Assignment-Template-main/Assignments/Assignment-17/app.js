// EVENTS
// 1. Create a signup form and display form data in your web 
// page on submission.



// 2. Suppose in your webpage there is content area in which 
// you have entered your item details, but user can only see 
// some details on first look. When user clicks on “Read 
// more” button, full detail of that particular item will be 
// displayed. 





// 3. In previous assignment you have created a tabular data 
// using javascript. Let’s modify that. Create a form which 
// takes student’s details and show each student detail in 
// table. Each row of table must contain a delete button and 
// an edit button. On click on delete button entire row should 
// be deleted. On click on edit button, a hidden form will 
// appear with the values of that row.
